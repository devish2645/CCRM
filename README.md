# CCRM
Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM) is a console-based Java application designed for an educational institute to manage student and course records. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) for administrators to handle core academic operations, including:
Managing students includes making, editing, and publishing their profiles.

Course management is the process of developing, maintaining, and looking for courses.

Grading and Enrollment: registering students for classes and keeping track of their grades.

File operations include importing beginning data and exporting the status of the application to files that resemble CSV files.

Timestamped backups of all application data are made for preservation purposes.


Built with Java SE, this project showcases a variety of fundamental Java ideas, such as Streams API, modern file I/O with NIO.2, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and fundamental design patterns.
